## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Frequently asked questions ‚ÑπÔ∏è

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I run the workshop on my computer?</strong></summary>

There is nothing preventing you from running the workshop on your own machine.
If you do so, you will need
* git installed on your local system
* [node 15 and npm 7 or later](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/free-developer-tools/blog/update-node-js/)

You will have to adapt commands and paths based on your environment and install the dependencies by yourself. **We won't provide support** to keep on track with schedule. However, we will do our best to give you the info you need to be successful.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What other prerequisites are there?</strong></summary>

* You will need a github account
* You will also need Netlify and Astra DB accounts, but we'll work through that in the exercises
* Use **Chrome** or **Firefox** for the best experience. Other browsers are great, but don't work well with the GitPod integration we use a bit later.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need to pay for anything for this workshop?</strong></summary>

**No.** All tools and services we provide here are FREE.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Will I get a certificate if I attend this workshop?</strong></summary>

## Homework

<img src="images/netflix-badge.png?raw=true" width="200" align="right" />

Don't forget to complete your upgrade and get your verified skill badge! Finish and submit your homework!

1. Complete the practice steps from this repository as described below.
2. Insert a movie OR genre of your choice in the database (It's OK to re-use the trailer file URL from another movie! Just make the title recognizable as yours).
3. Take a screenshot of your Netflix clone running either from your Gitpod or (better) deployed to production in Netlify (in this case, you could also give us the Netlify URL).
4. The screenshot should clearly show the movie/genre you added (make sure you tell us its name in the submission comment field as well).
5. (Optional for extra wisdom) Watch the 2-hour video by Ania [HERE](#video-tutorial-with-ania-kubow), build the app yourself, and show us the running final result.
6. Submit your homework [here](https://dtsx.io/homework-graphql-netflix).

That's it, you are done! Expect an email next few week(s)!

# Part 1 - DB Setup & Data Ingest

## 1. Login or Register to AstraDB and create database

> üéÅ *When creating your instance, use the promotion code **ANIA200** to get 200$ of additional free credit!*

_**`ASTRA DB`** is the simplest way to run Cassandra with zero operations at all - just push the button and get your cluster. No credit card required, 40M read/write operations and about 80GB storage monthly for free - sufficient to run small production workloads. If you use up your credits the databases will pause, no charge, and you will be given the option to upgrade to a higher tier._

Leveraging [Database creation guide](https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/create-instance/#c-procedure) create a database. *Right-Click the following button* with *Open in a new TAB.*

<a href="https://astra.dev/yt-01-04"><img src="images/create_astra_db.png?raw=true" /></a>

|Field|Value|
|---|---|
|**Database Name**| `workshops`|
|**Keyspace Name**| `netflix`|
|**Regions**| Select `GOOGLE CLOUD`, then an Area close to you, then a region with no LOCK üîí icons: the LOCKed regions are the region not accessible to the Free Tier.

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è Note:** If you already have a database `workshops`, simply add a keyspace `netflix` using the `Add Keyspace` button on the bottom right hand corner of the DB Dashboard page. You may have to "Resume" the database first in case it is in "hibernated" state.

While the database is being created, you will also get a **Security token** (needed to authenticate with your database and start using it):
**please IGNORE THIS ONE, as we will be soon creating a new, more powerful token for today**.

The status will change from `Pending` to `Active` when the database is ready, this usually only takes 2-3 minutes.


## 2. Create a security token

> Note: this step is very important, as the token generated automatically for you with
> the database lacks some permissions we'll use in the workshop.

[Create a token for your app](https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/create-token/#c-procedure), _using the **"Database Administrator"** role_.
Keep it handy for later use (best to download it in CSV format, as the values
will not be visible afterward).
This will provide authentication later when interacting with the database.
Today, in particular, we will need the string labeled "token" (the one starting with `AstraCS:...`).

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**
> ```
> The instructor will show the token creation on screen,
> but will then destroy it immediately for security reasons.
> ```


## 3. Create table **genre** with GraphQL

‚úÖ  **Step 3a:** Open **GraphQL Playground**:

0. Ensure you are logged on to your [Astra](https://astra.datastax.com) account
1. Click on the "workshops" database on the left (expanding the list if needed)
2. Click `Connect` TAB
3. Click the `APIs`  connection method
4. Make sure `GraphQL API` is selected
5. Locate the link to your GraphQL Playground in the text

![Open Astra DB GraphQL Playground image](images/open-playground-2.png)

<details>
<summary><strong>Click here if you are using the "New Astra Experience" UI</strong></summary>

![Open Astra DB GraphQL Playground image, new Astra UI](images/open-playground-2-wh.png)

</details>

**Note**: in the following, we will refer to "playground tabs". These are _not_ the tabs
in your browser, rather they are tabs _within_ the Playground application,
to switch between the (logically distinct) realms of "managing schema" and "managing data in the tables"
(more on that later).

![Playground tabs VS Browser tabs](images/tabs-vs-playgroundtabs-labeled.png)

‚úÖ  **Step 3b:** Insert the Astra DB Token to run schema queries

In the GraphQL Playground, **Populate HTTP HEADER** variable `x-cassandra-token` on the bottom of the page with your token (including the `AstraCS:` part).
_This is the "Database Administrator" token you created earlier on the Astra DB dashboard (Step 2 above)._

**Note**: make sure you are on the **`graphql-schema`** playground tab in this step, as this image illustrates:

![GraphQL Playground and token header, Schema playground tab](images/graphql-playground.png)

> Note: the GraphQL Playground starts with a ready-to-use _temporary token_ as the `x-cassandra-token` header. But we want the queries run in the Playground
> to be identical to those that the Netlify functions will run from code, so **please replace the token with your DB token as instructed**.

‚úÖ  **Step 3c:** In GraphQL Playground, create a table with the following mutation, (making sure to replace `netflix` if you used a different keyspace name):

- Copy the following mutation on the left panel
```yaml
mutation createReferenceList {
  reference_list: createTable(
    keyspaceName:"netflix",
    tableName:"reference_list",
    ifNotExists:true
    partitionKeys: [ 
      { name: "label", type: {basic: TEXT} }
    ]
    clusteringKeys: [
      { name: "value", type: {basic: TEXT}, order: "ASC" }
    ]
  )
}
```
* Use the big "play-button" arrow in the middle of the screen to execute the query

![image](images/playground-1.png?raw=true)

**GraphQL Playground troubleshooting** (covers this whole section)

|Trouble| Shooting|
|---|---|
|Server cannot be reached | Add Astra token to headers (including `AstraCS:...`; check quotes) |
|Server cannot be reached (second playground tab) | Check playground target URL ends with `netflix` |
Response not successful: Received status code 401 | Same as "server cannot be reached" |
| Response not successful: Received status code 404 | Check spelling of keyspace in target URL |
|"Play" button does nothing| Ensure query is syntactically correct |
"Validation error of type FieldUndefined" | Most likely query in the wrong playground tab, or writing to table not created yet |

## 4. Insert data in the Table with GraphQL

‚úÖ  **Step 4a:** In graphQL playground, change playground tab to now use `graphql`. Edit the end of the URl to change from `system` to the name of your keyspace: `netflix`

‚úÖ  **Step 4b:** Validate that **HTTP HEADER** got variable `x-cassandra-token` populated for you, on the bottom of the page. Put your token as shown below if not available.

![image](images/graphql-playground-2.png?raw=true)

‚úÖ  **Step 4c:** In GraphQL Playground,populate the `reference_list` table with the following values

- Copy the following mutation on the left panel

```yaml
mutation insertGenres {
  action: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Action"}) {
    value{value}
  }
  anime: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Anime"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  award: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Award-Winning"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  children: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Children & Family"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  classic: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Classic"}) {
     value{value}
  } 
  comedies: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Comedies"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  crime: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Crime"}) {
     value{value}
  } 
  cult: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Cult"}) {
     value{value}
  }  
  documentaries: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Documentaries"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  drama: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Dramas"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  fantasy: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Fantasy"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  french: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"French"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  horror: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Horror"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  independent: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Independent"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  international: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"International"}) {
     value{value}
  } 
  italian: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Italian"}) {
     value{value}
  } 
  musicmusicals: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Music & Musicals"}) {
     value{value}
  } 
  realitytv: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Reality TV"}) {
     value{value}
  } 
  romance: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Romance"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  scifi: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Sci-Fi"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  thriller: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Thriller"}) {
     value{value}
  } 
  tvshow: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"TV Show"}) {
     value{value}
  } 
}
```

* Use the big "play-button" arrow in the middle of the screen to execute the query

## 5. Retrieving list of values

‚úÖ  **Step 5a:** In GraphQL Playground, not changing playground tab (stay on the second: "graphql", yeah) list values from the table with the following query.

```yaml
query getAllGenre {
    reference_list (value: {label:"genre"}) {
      values {
      	value
      }
    }
}
```

*üëÅÔ∏è Expected output*
![image](images/graphql-playground-3.png?raw=true)

## 6. Creating a Movies Table

‚úÖ  **Step 6a:** Switch back to first playground tab ("graphql-schema"). The token header should be already set, use the following mutation to create a new table:

![image](images/graphql-back.png?raw=true)

_Remember to change the keyspaceName if you used something different_.

```yaml
mutation createMoviesTable {
  movies_by_genre: createTable(
    keyspaceName:"netflix",
    tableName:"movies_by_genre",
    ifNotExists: true,
    partitionKeys: [
      { name: "genre", type: {basic: TEXT} }
    ]
    clusteringKeys: [ 
      { name: "year", type: {basic: INT}, order: "DESC" },
      { name: "title", type: {basic: TEXT}, order: "ASC" }
    ]
    values: [
      { name: "synopsis", type: {basic: TEXT} },
      { name: "duration", type: {basic: INT} },
      { name: "thumbnail", type: {basic: TEXT} }
    ]
  )
}
```

*üëÅÔ∏è Expected output*
![image](images/graphql-playground-4.png?raw=true)

## 7. Insert Values in Movie table

‚úÖ  **Step 7a:** Now go to playground tab "graphql" again. 

![image](images/graphql-playground-2.png?raw=true)

Everything should be set: use the following mutation to populate the `movies_by_genre` table: 

```yaml
mutation insertMovies {
  inception: insertmovies_by_genre(
    value: { 
      genre:"Sci-Fi", 
      year:2010,
      title:"Inception",
      synopsis:"Cobb steals information from his targets by entering their dreams.",
      duration:121,
      thumbnail:"https://i.imgur.com/RPa4UdO.mp4"}) {
        value{title}
    }
  
  prometheus: insertmovies_by_genre(value: { 
      genre:"Sci-Fi", 
      year:2012,
      title:"Prometheus",
      synopsis:"After a clue to mankind's origins is discovered, explorers are sent to the darkest corner of the universe.",
      duration:134,
      thumbnail:"https://i.imgur.com/L8k6Bau.mp4"}) {
        value{title}
    }
  
  	aliens: insertmovies_by_genre(value: { 
      genre:"Sci-Fi", 
      year:1986,
      title:"Aliens",
      synopsis:"Ellen Ripley is sent back to the planet LV-426 to establish contact with a terraforming colony.",
      duration:134,
      thumbnail:"https://i.imgur.com/QvkrnyZ.mp4"}) {
        value{title}
    }
  
    bladeRunner: insertmovies_by_genre(value: { 
      genre:"Sci-Fi", 
      year:1982,
      title:"Blade Runner",
      synopsis:"Young Blade Runner K's discovery of a long-buried secret leads him to track down former Blade Runner Rick Deckard.",
      duration:145,
      thumbnail:"https://i.imgur.com/xhhvmj1.mp4"}) {
        value{title}
    }
  }
```

*üëÅÔ∏è Expected output*
![image](images/graphql-playground-5.png?raw=true)

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è You can find more movie data in the `data` folder, however, we will be doing a bulk import of all this data shortly.

## 8. Retrieve values from Movie tables

‚úÖ  **Step 8a:** In GraphQL Playground, not changing playground tab (stay on the second tab, "graphql", yeah) list values from the table with the following command:

```yaml
query getMovieAction {
    movies_by_genre (
      value: {genre:"Sci-Fi"},
       orderBy: [year_DESC]) {
      values {
        year,
        title,
        duration,
        synopsis,
        thumbnail
      }
    }
}
```

*üëÅÔ∏è Expected output*
![image](images/graphql-playground-6.png?raw=true)

‚úÖ **Step 8b Enable pagination:** For small datasets you can retrieve all values in the table but for performance or network reasons you need to perform pagination. Let's do same query as before now asking for a page size of 2:

```yaml
query getMovieAction {
    movies_by_genre (
      value: {genre:"Sci-Fi"},
       options: {pageSize: 2},
       orderBy: [year_DESC]) {
      values {
        year,
        title,
        duration,
        synopsis,
        thumbnail
      }
    pageState
    }
}
```

*üëÅÔ∏è Expected output*

![image](images/playground-2.png?raw=true)

‚úÖ **Step 8c: Fetch next page:** Notice that `pageState` now is also returned. Let's use it to fetch the next 2 items (next page). Edit the next query to replace `YOUR_PAGE_STATE` with your own string value:

```yaml
query getMovieAction {
    movies_by_genre (
      value: {genre:"Sci-Fi"},
       options: {pageSize: 2, pageState: "YOUR_PAGE_STATE"},
       orderBy: [year_DESC]) {
      values {
        year,
        title,
        duration,
        synopsis,
        thumbnail
      }
    pageState
    }
}
```
 
*üëÅÔ∏è Expected output*

![image](images/playground-3.png?raw=true)

If you try to paste the _newly-obtained_ value for `pageState` and re-run the query, you get an empty list and a null `pageState` in return. D'oh! We had scrolled through all rows already:
_this is how pagination signals the end of the full results list._

# Part 2 - Build and Deploy Front-End


## 1. Deploy to Netlify

‚úÖ **Step 1a: Netlify Button:** Click the following button to deploy to Netlify

- <details><summary> What does the netlify deploy button do?</summary>

The Netlify deploy button will:

- Create a new repository for you on Github (an unrelated _copy_, not a fork)
- Create a site on Netlify (and deploy a nonworking build of the app, which lacks the DB connection parameters still)
- Link the two together.

</details>

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-graphql-netflix)

<details><summary>Show me!</summary>

<img src="images/deploy-to-netlify.gif?raw=true" />

</details>

This will take a few minutes. You may have to authenticate through Github in the process.

_Note: if there is an existing account in Netlify, check the settings to make sure the Netlify account is connected to the your Github account._
<details>
  <summary>Show me! </summary>
  <img src="images/netlify-connect-01.png" />
</details>

‚úÖ **Step 1b: Check the deploy logs:** Click on `Site deploy in progress` within the Netlify UI.
<details>
  <summary>Show me! </summary>
  <img src="images/deploy-1.png" />
</details>

Then click the top deploy link to see the build process.
<details>
  <summary>Show me! </summary>
  <img src="images/deploy-2.png" />
</details>

‚úÖ **Step 1c: Complete the build:** Wait until the build shows `Netlify Build Complete`,  **When you see Pushing to repository** you're ready to move on.
<details>
  <summary>Show me! </summary>
  <img src="images/deploy-3.png" />
</details>

‚úÖ **Step 1d: Get back to your new site:** Scroll up to the top and click on the site name (it'll be after "_[your login]_'s Team" next to the Netlify button).
<details>
  <summary>Show me! </summary>
  <img src="images/deploy-4.png" />
</details>

## 2. Launch Gitpod from YOUR Github repo

‚úÖ **Step 2a: Jump to YOUR repo:** Click on the `GitHub` in `Deploys from GitHub` to get back to your new repository.
Scroll to where you were in the README.
<details>
  <summary>Show me! </summary>
  <img src="images/deploy-5.png" />
</details>

**Note** At this point, you MUST be reading this README from **YOUR** Github repository.
That is, if the address bar still says `https://github.com/datastaxdevs/...` please
head over to YOUR copy of the repo before going the Gitpod route!

‚úÖ **Step 2b: Launch Gitpod:** Use this link to open Gitpod from **YOUR** repository! (_Tip: Ctrl-click on the button_)

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/from-referrer/)

_Note: the button works on <img src="images/chrome-logo.svg" height="20"/> Chrome and <img src="images/firefox-logo.svg" height="20"/> Firefox._

<details>
<summary>Click to troubleshoot if you have another browser</summary>

<img src="images/gitpod_trick.png" />

</details>

‚ÑπÔ∏è _It may take a few minutes (approx. 3-5) for GitPod to fully initialize._

Gitpod will be your IDE from now on. If you are familiar with VSCode, you can probably
just use it. Otherwise, take a moment to review a separate page
["Know your Gitpod"](know_your_gitpod.md)
and then come back here.

## 3. Setup and use `astra-cli`

You are going to use a CLI tool to simplify operations with Astra DB. The tool
is preinstalled on your Gitpod.

‚úÖ **Step 3a: Set up the CLI:** Run the following in the Gitpod terminal and,
when prompted, enter the `AstraCS:...` you obtained at the beginning.

``` bash
astra setup
```

**üëÅÔ∏è Expected output**

![astra-cli](images/astra-cli-setup.png?raw=true)

‚úÖ **Step 3b: Bulk data load:** Load a large movie dataset in the database.
This command, in turn, installs and properly launches the `DSBulk` tool:

``` bash
astra db load workshops \
  -url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-graphql-netflix/master/data/movies_by_genre.csv \
  -k netflix \
  -t movies_by_genre
```

<details><summary>Show the syntax for old versions of astra-cli</summary>

Note: you should not need this.

```bash
astra db dsbulk workshops load \
  -url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-graphql-netflix/master/data/movies_by_genre.csv \
  -k netflix \
  -t movies_by_genre
```

> *Note*: we mock the trailers for these thousands of movies by using a handful
> of them over and over. Don't be surprised if you'll see the wrong trailers
> for your favorite movie!

</details>

**üëÅÔ∏è Expected output**

![astra-cli](images/astra-cli-dsbulk.png?raw=true)

That's it! All 6000+ movies are now loaded and ready to go!


## 4. Serverless Functions

Take a look at `functions/getGenres.js`

```javascript
const fetch = require('node-fetch')

exports.handler = async function (event) {

  const body = JSON.parse(event.body)
  const url = process.env.ASTRA_DB_GRAPHQL_URL
  const query = `
    query getAllGenres {
      reference_list (
        value: { label: "genre"},
        options: {
          pageSize: ${JSON.stringify(body.pageSize)},
          pageState: ${JSON.stringify(body.pageState)}
        }
      ) {
        values {
          value
        }
        pageState
      }
    }
  `

  const response = await fetch(url, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "x-cassandra-token": process.env.ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ query })
  })

  try {
    const responseBody = await response.json()
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify(responseBody)
    }
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e)
    return {
      statusCode: 500,
      body: JSON.stringify(e)
    }
  }
}
```

You'll notice the familiar GraphQL query "getAllGenres" we used previously in the playground. It's been modified a bit to utilize pagination.
When building the GraphQL query, we pass the desired page size and state to the GraphQL API:

```javascript
options: {
  pageSize: ${JSON.stringify(body.pageSize)},
  pageState: ${JSON.stringify(body.pageState)}
}
```

We ask the API server to give us back the table column "value" (containing the genre name), but also the page state
for when we'll need the next page:

```javascript
{
  values {
    value
  }
  pageState
}
```

The serverless function `functions/getMovies.js` works in much the same way, though we pass in the specific genre we want, and are hardcoding a page size of 6:

```javascript
query {
  movies_by_genre (
    value: { genre: ${JSON.stringify(genre)}},
    orderBy: [year_DESC],
    options: { pageSize: 6, pageState: ${JSON.stringify(pageState)} }
  ) {
    values {
      year,
      title,
      duration,
      synopsis,
      thumbnail
    }
    pageState
  }
}
```

</details>

## 5. Fetching from the Front-End

<details><summary>Show me this section</summary>

Let's take a look at how we fetch from these serverless functions from the front-end. Start in `src/App.js`

We have a fetch method defined that will retrieve a page of genres by calling the `getGenres` serverless function.

```javascript
const fetchData = async () => {
  if (! isFetching)  {
    setIsFetching(true)
    const response = await fetch("/.netlify/functions/getGenres", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify({pageState, pageSize}),
    })
    const responseBody = await response.json()
    setPageState(responseBody.data.reference_list.pageState)
    setGenres(gs => (gs || []).concat(responseBody.data.reference_list.values))
    setIsFetching(false)
  }
}
```

We pass in the current `pageState` and `pageSize` state variables and receive a response from the serverless function. We then set the `pageState` var to the new pagestate, and set the `genres` state variable to the received data. (Note that we are concatenating the new data to the var, since we want to keep all previously fetched data, not replace).

When rendering the page, we generate a `<Section>` component for each genre, plus a `<div>` at the bottom, which will detect a mouseEnter event and trigger loading a new page of genres:

```javascript
<>
  <NavBar />
  <HeroSection />
  {genres && (
    <div className="container">
      {Object.values(genres).map((genre) => (
        <Section key={genre.value} genre={genre.value} />
      ))}
    </div>
  )}
  <div
    className="page-end"
    onMouseEnter={() => {
      setRequestedPage( np => np + 1 )
    }}
  />
</>
```

The `<Section>` component works in the same way, though we will fully replace the data in the `movies` variable.

```javascript
const fetchData = async () => {
  const response = await fetch("/.netlify/functions/getMovies", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({ genre: genre, pageState: pageState }),
  })
  const responseBody = await response.json()
  setMovies(responseBody.data.movies_by_genre.values)
  setPageState(responseBody.data.movies_by_genre.pageState)
}
```

Now that we know how the front-end works, let's launch our app!

</details>

## 6. Install the Netlify CLI

In the `workshop-graphql-netflix` directory, run the following:

```
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

<details><summary>Show me!</summary>
<img src="images/netlify-install-cli.png?raw=true" />
</details>

With the Netlify command-line interface you will build and deploy
the application directly from the Gitpod terminal.

## 7. Provide DB connection parameters

The "serverless functions" part of your app, in order to speak to
your DB through GraphQL, needs two important pieces of information:
the API endpoint and the token. You will now create a `.env` file which
defines them as environment variables.

The quickest way is to have `astra-cli` generate one for you:

```
astra db create-dotenv -k netflix workshops
```

<details><summary>I want to do it manually</summary>

If for some reason you don't use `astra-cli`, follow these steps:

- copy `cp .env.sample .env` and open it: `gp open .env`;
- `.env` is now open in the IDE editor and has two placeholders to replace:
- insert the `AstraCS:...` database token (keep the quotes);
- insert the GraphQL API address (it will look something like `https://b2f[...]/graphql/netflix`).

You can generate a new database token if you want. The GraphQL address
can be found in the playground: it is the URL you have edited to end in `netflix`
_inside the second playground tab, which has its own address bar_ (as opposed to your browser's).

</details>

## 8. Run the app in dev mode

‚úÖ **Step 8a: Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

‚úÖ **Step 8b: Start the app:** With the command

```
netlify dev
```

the application should automatically be displayed in GitPod's "simple browser".
Note that in this **dev-mode run** everything is local to your Gitpod instance:
_the "serverless functions", in particular, are actually running there,
alongside the rest of the application!_

<details><summary>Show me!</summary>

![run-in-preview-pane](images/preview.png)

</details>

You can copy the URL in Gitpod's simple browser and open in a new tab
(of your real browser, that is) for a
better experience. But now let's move to the actual deploy phase.

## 9. Connect to your Netlify site

‚úÖ **Step 9a:** Stop the dev run with `Ctrl-C`.

‚úÖ **Step 9b:** Authenticate with Netlify: run

```
netlify login
```

then grab the URL printed on the console
(something like `https://app.netlify.com/authorize?response[...]`)
and manually **open it in a new tab** (Gitpod blocks it for security).
You will be asked to authorize "netlify-cli" to access your Netlify account
in the process.

<details><summary>Show me!</summary>

![Netlify login](images/waiting_for_authorization.png)

</details>

Once you complete the login, you will see a console output like:

```
You are now logged into your Netlify account!
Run netlify status for account details
To see all available commands run: netlify help
```

‚úÖ **Step 9c:** Associate to your Netlify site: run

```
netlify link
```

and make sure you confirm the choice of associating to
"current git remote origin".

<details><summary>Show me!</summary>

![Netlify link](images/netlify-link.png)

</details>

## 10. Deploy in production!

‚úÖ **Step 10a:** Inject secrets to the Netlify site

```
netlify env:import .env
```

Now the (actually) serverless functions in Netlify have the connection
parameters they need.

<details><summary>Show me!</summary>

![image](images/netlify_env_import.png)

</details>

‚úÖ **Step 10b:** Build the app

Run
```
netlify build
```
‚úÖ **Step 10c:** Deploy!

```
netlify deploy --prod
```

‚úÖ **Step 10d:** Visit your site.

```
netlify open:site
```

If needed, manually copy-paste your site URL in a new browser tab... and enjoy
your work!
